                    Body: "Terrorists, presumably with the help of Pakistan, killed our eighteen soldiers in a wee hours attack on a military base in the town of Uri, Jammu and Kashmir. Now in the aftermath of the raid some readers are asking the fellow readers a question in online newspapers: what do you want Prime Minister Modi to do? This is a wrong question to ask because it makes no difference what you or I feel Modi ought to do. A question should be whether or not Modi’s two approaches, be friendly and be manly, in dealing with matters related to foreign affairs are working. Prime Minister Modi believes friendliness should bring peace to the region.  When he came to power in 2014, Modi invited to his swearing-in ceremony Pakistan Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif and chatted with him. Following year Prime Minister Modi made a surprise visit to Nawaz Sharif on 25th of December 2015, the day Sharif turned 66.  Modi said on Twitter “spent a warm evening with Sharif family at their family home,” following the birthday bash.  “Am personally touched by Nawaz Sharif Sahab's gesture of welcoming me at Lahore airport and coming to the airport when I left,” said Modi in another tweet from Pakistan.     There is nothing new in what Prime Minister Modi is doing; other prime ministers also have tried to develop personal friendship with foreign leaders.  But this kind of approach is unlikely to work, and when it comes to Pakistan it is its military – not its elected leaders – that decides how Pakistan should behave with India.     Prime Minister Modi frequently travels overseas. He tweets to world leaders all the time.  For examples, after his visit to Japan, Modi tweeted to Prime Minister Shinzo Abe a happy birthday wish.  Once he tweeted a happy birthday wish to Afghanistan Prime Minister way before his birthday.  It is also reported that Narendra Modi calls the U.S. President Barack Obama, Barack.      A practice of tweeting to a head of state or addressing a world leader by first name does not work.  Modi believes he is in the club of world’s top leaders.  May be he is in.  But in reality, there is no such thing as personal diplomacy or the league because the nations’ leaders come and go but the country’s interest stays and comes first.      A reader (avatar) named Rationalist/Rebel said it well in his comment in the First Post online paper on 22 September 2016:      It is infact Modi himself who created this Frankenstein monster of hyper-Nationalism with his vitriolic, rabble rousing, acerbic, and chest thumping speeches to cater to his constituency in his stint as Gujarat CM and as a Prime Ministerial nominee to assiduously cultivate a machismo image with aggression as his forte, to market himself as an outsider and enhance his saleability[sic] by differentiation from those housed in the Lutyens of Delhi.      Now, he is just reaping what he sowed having driven wild his legion of Bhakths into a mad frenzy with his facetious immature and irresponsible approach to critical governance issues including diplomatic relations with Pakistan and handling of the Kashmir problem. If his legion of Bhakths are baying for blood and monger for war, the credit should go to Modi himself as he stirred and stimulated their emotions and passions and gave an impression that he had all the answers with a mere touch of finger. However, today the very ghost of exaggerated expectations he created is haunting him when he is compelled by force of circumstances and the complexity of problem interwined[sic] with geo political and geo economic ramifications mellowing him down making him understand today the limitations of governance despite the power he wields.      There cannot be a bigger hyper Nationalist than Modi himself.       Modi calls himself a strongman, a nationalist, a man with 56 inch chest.  During the 2014 campaign, he often labeled his predecessor Manmohan Singh a feeble man.  Modi told voters in his rousing speeches that when he came to power he would bring ten Pakistani heads for every Indian soldier killed by the enemy.       Narendra Modi came to power in May 2014, and since then many Indian soldiers have lost their lives in terrorist attacks including the one on the Indian Air Force base in Pathankot and now on the Indian Army base in Uri.  But so far Modi has done little to punish perpetrators who have been carrying out strikes on our soil.       Many voters are now saying to Prime Minister Modi that we believed in you, as well as in your words, when you ran for the office and, now after the election, your words still matter to us.  You have lost credibility.       What should Modi do? Know that foreign travel, intimacy with foreign leaders, and macho image are not working.",
